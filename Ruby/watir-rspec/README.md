### Set up Bundle Configuration

Follow these steps to create bundle config file:

1. Open the terminal and run the following commands to create cgi username and password.

    a. Run the following command to activate Ruby.

    ```sh
    irb
    ```

    b. Run the following command to trigger cgi.

    ```sh
    require "cgi"
    ```

    It returns `true`.

    c. Run the following command to cgi email id.

    ```sh
    CGI.escape <"email-id">
    ```

    It returns cgi escaped email.

    d. Run the following command to cgi api key.

    ```sh
    CGI.escape <"api-key">
    ```

    It returns cgi escaped api key.

2. Run the following command to create the config file.

```sh
bundle config agora.dequecloud.com <username>:<api-key> 
```

It creates the config file with your credentialss.

The following command installs all the required dependencies to run this example project.

```sh
bundle install
```

## Run Tests

The **_spec_** directory contains the example test files **`example_spec.rb`** and **`spec_helper.rb`** that analyzes the page `https://broken-workshop.dequelabs.com/` for accessibility issues.

The following command runs the test files in the **_spec_** directory.

```sh
bin/rspec
```

## Test Results

The tests generate results in the **_a11y-results_** directory.

The **`executive-report.html`** file is an executive summary report aggregating results from all scans into one page.

Every time you run **`bin/rspec`**, it replaces all previously saved results with the latest results in the **`a11y-results`** directory, so if you want to retain previous test results, you should rename or save them in a different directory. 

If you want to modify this project and publish your results in a folder other than **`./ally-results`**, you should update the output directory in the **`example_spec.rb`** file.
