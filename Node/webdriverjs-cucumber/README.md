# axe DevTools WebDriverJS API with Cucumber Example

Using axe DevTools WebDriverJS with Cucumber, you can integrate axe DevTools into your existing testing environment. This example project demonstrates how axe DevTools WebDriverJS with Cucumber is used to detect accessibility issues and generates reports in CSV, HTML, JSON, and XML formats.

## Prerequisites

- npm
- NodeJS (6.10 or higher)

## Clone Project

Follow these steps to clone and navigate to the directory:

1. Clone this repo from GitHub.
2. Open the project in your favourite editor.
3. Navigate from the root of the repo to this example with the following command:

```sh
cd Node/webdriverjs-cucumber
```

## Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies including **axe DevTools WebDriverJS** and **DevTools Reporter** for the project.

> **_NOTE:_**
> You need a valid license to use our APIs. For more information, see [Install from Dequeâ€™s Agora](https://docs.deque.com/devtools-html/4.0.0/en/node-pl-install-agora) page. After configuring the access to Deque's private registry, you can install the dependencies for this project.

The following command installs all the required dependencies to run this example project.

```sh
npm install
```

## Run Tests

The **_features_** directory contains the example test file **`example-steps.js`** that analyzes the page `https://broken-workshop.dequelabs.com/` for accessibility issues.

The following command runs the test file in the **_features_** directory.

```sh
npm test
```

## Test Results

The tests generate results in the **_a11y-results_** directory. Check each subdirectory for the respective format.

The **`/html/executive-report.html`** file is an executive summary report aggregating results from all scans into one page.

## Test Run Configuration

**`npm test`** runs the **`rimraf`** command mentioned in the **`package.json`**.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "rimraf ./a11y-results && cucumber-js"
  },
```

Every time you run **`npm test`**, the **`rimraf`** command clears all saved results from the **`a11y-results`** directory, so if you want to retain previous test results, you should remove **`rimraf`** from the **`scripts`** object.

If you want to modify this project and publish your results in a folder other than **`./ally-results`**, you should update the output directory in the test file and the **test** parameter.
